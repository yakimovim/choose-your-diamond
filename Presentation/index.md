## Diamonds color

There are some things you should consider if you want to choose a diamond. One of them is color. Internationally recognized laboratories (GIA & IGI for example) use a grading scale for diamonds in the normal color range. The scale ranges from D which is totally colorless to Z which is a pale yellow or brown color. Brown diamonds darker than K color are usually described using their letter grade, and a descriptive phrase, for example M Faint Brown. Diamonds with more depth of color than Z color fall into the fancy color diamond range.

You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_color).

The best diamonds have color between D and J.

## Diamonds cut

A diamond cut is a style or design guide used when shaping a diamond for polishing such as the brilliant cut. Cut does not refer to shape (pear, oval), but the symmetry, proportioning and polish of a diamond. The cut of a diamond greatly affects a diamond's brilliance; this means if it is cut poorly, it will be less luminous.

## Diamonds clarity

Diamond clarity is the quality of diamonds that relates to the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called inclusions, and surface defects, called blemishes. Clarity is one of the four Cs of diamond grading, the others being carat, color, and cut.
